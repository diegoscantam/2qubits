## About

:warning: :hammer_and_wrench: This repository is a work in progress in constant development!

Implementation of a Python simulation of a quantum system of a few qubits. A variational estimate of the ground state energy of the deuterion is simulated on a Qiskit quantum circuit. This is done in two different ways, one being the representation of each quantum harmonic oscillator state the nucleus can occupy as a qubit, the other being the relative mixing between singlet and triplet spin states of the system mapped into a two qubits circuit.

The present work is done in collaboration with [TIFPA (Trento Institute for Fundamental Physics and Applications)](https://www.tifpa.infn.it/) research centre as part of a quantum computing internship.
