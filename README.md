## About
Implementation of a Python simulation of a quantum system of a few qubits. A variational estimate of the ground state energy of the deuteron is simulated on a Qiskit quantum circuit. This is done in two different ways, one being the representation of each quantum harmonic oscillator state the nucleus can occupy as a qubit, the other being the relative mixing between singlet and triplet spin states of the system mapped into a two qubits circuit. Secondly, some quantum correction algorithms are implemented.

The present work is done in collaboration with [TIFPA (Trento Institute for Fundamental Physics and Applications)](https://www.tifpa.infn.it/) research centre as part of a quantum computing internship.

## Deuteron: the deuterium nucleus
The deuteron is the bound state of a proton and a neutron. In order to estimate the binding energy of the system, there are two main approaches one could follow involving a simulation on a quantum computer.

The first being the one mapping the creation and destruction operators of the deuteron into combinations of Pauli gates. The ladder operators $a_n^\dagger$ and $a_n$ create and annihilate a deuteron in the harmonic oscillator state $|n \rangle$. The Hamiltonian is of the form

$$
H_N = \sum_{n,n'=0}^{N-1} \langle n' | T+V | n \rangle a_{n'}^\dagger a_n.
$$

Thanks to the Jordan-Wigner transformation, the Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of Pauli matrices, allowing us to map it into a quantum circuit with $N$ qubits. By calculating the variational ground state energies for $H_1$, $H_2$ and $H_3$, one can extrapolate the infinite-basis binding energy using the harmonic oscillator variant of LÃ¼scher formula.
